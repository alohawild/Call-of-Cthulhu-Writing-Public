Call-of-Cthulhu-Writing-Public
==============================

This is my writing for the public for my adventures using Call of Cthulhu.

Portland at the End

The new version of Call of Cthulhu 7th edition is not out yet, but it seemed still possible with the basic introductory PDF to write a adventure for it. I have built an open content adventure for it. 

Introduction
It is time for the End and where is there a better place to be for the End than in the rainy season of 2012 in Portland, Oregon? Ancient stories are recast as the stars become right in Portland. Nearly forgotten treasures and digs of lost cities find their way to Portland. A cult finally has the power and knowledge to bring and End of this human era and begins again the eldritch horror age of the past. Is 21 December 2012â€™s Saturday Market in Portland the place of the apocalypse?
