Call-of-Cthulhu-Writing-Public
==============================

This is my writing for the public for my adventures using Call of Cthulhu.

Portland at the End

The new version of Call of Cthulhu 7th edition is not out yet, but it seemed still possible with the basic introductory PDF to write a adventure for it. I have built an open content adventure for it. 

Introduction
It is time for the End and where is there a better place to be for the End than in the rainy season of 2012 in Portland, Oregon? Ancient stories are recast as the stars become right in Portland. Nearly forgotten treasures and digs of lost cities find their way to Portland. A cult finally has the power and knowledge to bring and End of this human era and begins again the eldritch horror age of the past. Is 21 December 2012â€™s Saturday Market in Portland the place of the apocalypse?

The docx is my current version. I update the PDF once in a while.

Gaslight The Yorkshore Horrors

This is a rework of the 1986 Adventure to use Savage Worlds. You have to have the old 1986 Gaslight set really to play this.
I do have an original copy (and an orginal Call of Cthulhu set).

In this adventure the in the 1890s in England the players meet Sherlock Holmes! It is difficult adventure to play as it is 
hard to work out the action sequences. I redid the action to make it more clear and logical to me. ]
Anyone with the original set could use my notes to play with Savage Worlds and Call of Cthlhu.

When an Unexpected Card Is Drawn

This is an original work from me set in the 80's that recalls my days learning software development in Michigan, USA.
I have recreated some of the old systems and ways we use to do things back then.
This is a fun Savaga Worlds and Agents of Oblivion fan work that I put together for my own campaign.
It would easily convert to any of the horror systems. Enjoy! 

Istanbul Discovery 

This is set in a more tradtional 1926 for Call of Cthulhu and is for 7th Edition.
This is a quick introduction to Istanbul in 1926 and four short adventurers in the city.
